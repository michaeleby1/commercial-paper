# Treasury Spread

This notebook charts the spread of a key indicator of economic recessions: the treasury yield curve. Specifically, the notebook  models the spread between the yield of 10-year treasuries and the yield of 2-year treasuries. Historically, a negative spread indicates that a recession is looming. 

Long-term treasuries typically have much larger yields than short-term treasuries. The reason for this is because, in healthy economic periods, confidence in the bond market causes investors to buy short-term treasuries, driving their yield down relative to long-term treasuries. 

This data comes from the [St. Louis Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). It dates back from 1976 to the present day.
