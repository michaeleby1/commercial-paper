# Treasury Spread

This notebook charts key indicator of economic recessions: the treasury yield curve. Specifically, it models the spread between the yield of 10-year treasuries and the yield of 2-year treasuries. A negative spread is often seen as a sign that recession is looming. 

In healthy economic periods, long-term treasuries typically have much larger yields than short-term treasuries. This is because confidence in the bond market causes investors to buy short-term treasuries, driving the yield of those treasuries down relative to long-term ones. 

This data comes from the [St. Louis Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). It dates back from 1976 to the present day.
